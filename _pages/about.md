I’m Danish and live in Berlin with my wife and two sons. I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en) in [Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzki](http://www.aip.de/Members/lwisotzki/)’s [group](http://www.aip.de/en/research/research-area-ea/research-groups-and-projects/galaxies). 

My main research revolves around Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) during (z>6) and after (z<6) the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). I use LBGs and LAEs as probes of galaxy formation at these epochs. Using three dimensional spectroscopy (mainly from the MUSE IFU on VLT and the near-infrared grisms onboard Hubble) we can probe the physics of galaxies over a large fraction of the lifetime of the Universe. Doing that, I attempt to help piece together the puzzle of how galaxies formed and evolved. Using spectroscopic confirmations of LBGs, spectra of LAEs and their luminosity functions, we furthermore obtain general information about the intergalactic medium throughout the history of the Universe. 

My research is done as part of large surveys and international collaborations including the MUSE Consortium and [The MUSE-Wide survey](https://musewide.aip.de), [The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS)](http://glass.astro.ucla.edu/), [The GLASS JWST ERS program](http://glass.astro.ucla.edu/ers/) and [The Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG)](http://borg.astro.ucla.edu) survey.

I started working at AIP in 2015 after 3 and a bit years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/).
I moved there after completing my PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/), as an [ELIXIR](http://www.iap.fr/elixir/) Marie Curie PhD Fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hans-Walter Rix](http://www.mpia.de/rix). 

In my spare time I spend time with my family, play basketball, run, scuba-dive from time to time, and exploit Berlin’s many concert venues.
