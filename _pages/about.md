I’m Danish and live in Berlin with my wife and son. I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en) in [Prof. Dr. Lutz Wisotzki](http://www.aip.de/Members/lwisotzki/)’s [group](http://www.aip.de/en/research/research-area-ea/research-groups-and-projects/galaxies). 

My main research revolves around Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) during (z>6) and after (z<6) the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). I use LBGs and LAEs as probes of galaxy formation at these epochs. Using three dimensional spectroscopy (mainly from the MUSE IFU on VLT and the near-infrared grisms onboard Hubble) we can probe the physics of galaxies over the majority of the lifetime of the Universe. Doing that, I attempt to help piece together the puzzle of how galaxies formed and evolved. Using spectroscopic confirmations of LBGs, spectra of LAEs and their luminosity functions, we furthermore obtain general information about the intergalactic medium throughout the history of the Universe. 

My research is done as part of large surveys and international collaborations including the MUSE Consortium and the MUSE-Wide survey, [The Grism Lens-Amplified Survey from Space (GLASS)](http://glass.astro.ucla.edu/) and [The Brightest of Reionizing Galaxies (BoRG)](http://borg.astro.ucla.edu) survey.

I started working at AIP after 3 and a bit years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/),
where I moved to after having earned my PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/), as an [ELIXIR](http://www.iap.fr/elixir/) Marie Curie Fellow under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Hans-Walter Rix](http://www.mpia.de/rix). 

In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, playing basketball, running a bit, scuba-diving from time to time, listening to music and exploiting Berlin’s many concert venues.
