I’m Danish and live in Berlin with my wife and son. I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP). I started here after 3 and a bit years at UC Santa Barbara and a PhD at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg. In my spare time I enjoy my family, play basketball, run a bit, scuba-dive from time to time, and spend a lot of time listening to music and exploiting Berlin’s many concert venues.
