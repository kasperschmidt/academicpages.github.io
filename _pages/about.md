I’m Danish and live in Berlin with my wife and son. I’m working as a postdoctoral researcher at the 
[Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP)](http://www.aip.de/en). 
I started here after 3 and a bit years at 
[UC Santa Barbara](http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~astrogroup/) 
and a PhD at the 
[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg](http://www.mpia.de/). 

In my spare time I enjoy my family, play basketball, run a bit, scuba-dive from time to time, listen to music and enjoy exploiting Berlin’s many concert venues.
