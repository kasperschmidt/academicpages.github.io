The GLASS Inspection GUIs: GiG, GiGz & GiGm

As part of the GLASS NIR spectroscopic data releases, we developed a set of GUIs for inspecting and classifying the GLASS spectra (GiG), manually determining the objects redshifts (GiGz) and classifying the morphology of the continuum and star formation maps (GiGm). The tools are presented by [Treu, Schmidt et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...812..114T/abstract) and [Vulcani et al. (2016)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...833..178V). They are available at:
