Bayesian Algorithm for Luminosity Function Fitting (BALFF)

As part of Schmidt et al. (2014) we developed a Bayesian framework to fit galaxy luminosity functions. The framework has been extended to included the capability of accounting for weak and strong lensing magnification bias as presented by Mason, Treu, Schmidt, et al. (2015). The code is at:
