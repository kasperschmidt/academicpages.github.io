Bayesian Algorithm for Luminosity Function Fitting (BALFF)

As part of [Schmidt et al. (2014)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...786...57S) we developed a Bayesian framework to fit galaxy luminosity functions. The framework has been extended to included the capability of accounting for weak and strong lensing magnification bias as presented by [Mason, Treu, Schmidt, et al. (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...805...79M). The code is availbale from:
