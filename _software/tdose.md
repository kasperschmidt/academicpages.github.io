TDOSE is a Python tool for optimally extracting 1D spectra from IFU data cubes. It is based on the point source extraction software presented in Kamann et al. (2013), added the ability to handle extended sources, i.e., galaxies and other non-stellar objects contained in the data cubes. TDOSE has been developed with MUSE in mind, but should be applicable to any data cube. Details will be provided in a forthcoming publication, but in the meantime, a readme is available together with the code at
