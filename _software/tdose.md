TDOSE is a Python tool for optimally extracting 1D spectra from IFU data cubes. Version 3.0 is presented by [Schmidt et al. (2019)](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190605891S). TDOSE is based on the point source extraction software presented by [Kamann, Wisotzki and Roth (2013)](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013A%26A...549A..71K), added the ability to handle extended sources, i.e., galaxies and other non-stellar objects contained in the data cubes. TDOSE has been developed with MUSE in mind, but is applicable to any 3D data cube. A readme is available together with the code at <https://github.com/kasperschmidt/TDOSE> but for details have a look at [Schmidt et al. (2019)](http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190605891S).
