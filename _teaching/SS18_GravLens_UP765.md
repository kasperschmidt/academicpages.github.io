## Course Description

The theory of gravitational lensing (GL) is one of the three fundamental observational consequences of Einsteinâ€™s theory of general relativity. GL describes how rays of light are bent by massive astronomical objects like stars, galaxies and galaxy clusters. This results in magnification and potentially in multiple images on the sky of lensed sources. 

These unique consequences of GL have been instrumental and of growing importance in modern extragalactic astronomy. Laying out the theoretical framework describing the principles and consequences of GL, this course will focus on recent studies enabled by GL and on scientific applications, where GL plays a crucial role. These include galaxy (cluster) mass determination, spatially resolved mapping of low-mass galaxies in the distant Universe, determining the expansion rate of the Universe, and detecting planets around other stars. 

In weekly seminars the course will focus on "astronomer skill development", which will introduce and explore tasks and tools used on a daily to weekly basis by most astronemers. This includes text review, problem solving, scientific outreach preparation, presentation skills, etc.

Hence, this course provides a broad overview of gravitaional lensing from both the observational and theoretical side, and help develop personal skills for general use in astronomy.
